# iLyrics
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iLyrics is a web application that utilizes the iTunes API and lyrics.ovh API and insodoing allows a user to get the lyrics for songs that iTunes offers.  

## Motivation A
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was the manifestation of a drill given to me during my time at Galvanize's Web Development Immersive program.  Here's a brief description of the project requirements:


>For this project, you will build a light application that reads data, has end-to-end testing, and integrates with an API. The topic is up >to you, so pick a project that speaks to your interests.

>Instructions

>You should have a brochure page that has information about what your app does and who it's for.

>Your app should make a GET request to an external API.

>Your app should also pull from a second source of data. This can be another API, another endpoint on the same API, or from a local .json >file.

>You need to write some data transformation that combines the two objects in a meaningful way.

>The resulting data should be dynamically added to the page.

>You should allow a user to change the API end point. For example, get data about a specific movie, weather for a specific zip code, etc.

>Your app should have end-to-end tests.

>Deploy your app.

## Motivation B
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love music!  And, what makes music even more rich to me is when I know the lyrics to a song.  So, since I still use iTunes for my music, and since I needed to use two different APIs for this project, voil√†--iLyrics.
